programs run faster!<p>

6 Some compilers, e.g. Metrowerks Macintosh C compiler, have an option <p>
Require function prototypes<p>
which can be turned on. If it is on, then the compiler will issue errors if the
specification is not included - because the function prototypes (the formal
specification of the methods of our objects) are in the specification. Other
compilers, e.g. GNU gcc, will only issue warnings if the function prototypes
are absent.<p>
<a name="fn0">[7 Or possibly used as "advice" to the system - enabling it to
pre-allocated space in some efficient way, e.g. in a contiguous block in one
page of memory.<p>
8 Maintenance is well known to be the most costly phase of any large software
development project, refer to any text on Software Engineering.]</a><p>

<a name="fn1">[10 In fact, adding and deleting from the head of a linked list
is the simplest implementation and produces exactly the LIFO semantics of a
stack.<p>
11 In most operating systems, allocation and de-allocation of memory is a
relatively expensive operation, there is a penalty for the flexibility of
linked list implementations.]</a><p>

13 You will find that not many people will be happy with a prediction that 90%
of the time, this computer will calculate the (new position of the aircraft's
flaps|the fastest rate at which the brakes can be applied|...) to prevent (the
aircraft crashing|hitting the car in front|...).
