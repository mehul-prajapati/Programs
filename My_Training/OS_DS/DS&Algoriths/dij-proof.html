We use a proof by contradiction again.
But first, we assert the following Lemma:
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD><B>Lemma 1</B>
<P>
Shortest paths are composed of shortest paths.
<P>
The proof of this is based on the notion that if
there was a shorter path than any sub-path, then
the shorter path should replace that sub-path to
make the whole path shorter.<B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B>Lemma 2</B>
<P>
If s ->..-> u -> v is a shortest path from s to v,
then after u has been added to S and relax(u,v,w)
called, then d[v] = delta(s,v) and d[v] is not
changed thereafter.
<I>For formal proofs, see Cormen or any one
of the texts which cover this important algorithm.</I>
<P>
Proof follows from the fact that at all times
d[v] >= delta(s,v).
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
Denote the distance of the shortest path from <B>s</B> to <B>u</B>
as <B>delta(s,u)</B>.
After running Dijkstra's algorithm, we assert that
<B>d[u] = delta(s,u)</B> for all <B>u</B>.
<P>
Note that once <B>u</B> is added to <B>S</B>,
<B>d[u]</B> is not changed and should be <B>delta(s,u)</B>.
<P>
<H4>Proof by contradiction</H4>
<P>
Suppose that <B>u</B> is the first vertex added to <B>S</S>
for which <B>d[u] != delta(s,u)</B>.
We note:
<OL>
<LI> u cannot be s, because d[s] = 0.
<LI> There must be a path from s to u.
If there were not, d[u] would be infinity.
<LI> Since there is a path, there must be a shortest path.
</OL>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC=fig/dij-proof.gif></TD>
<TD>
Let s -(p1)-> x -> y -(p2)-> u be the shortest path
from s to u.
Where x is within S and y is the first vertex not within S.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
When x was inserted into S, d[x] = delta(s,x)
(since we hypothesise that u was the first vertex
for which this was not true).
<P>
Edge (x,y) was relaxed at that time, so that<BR>
d[y] = delta(s,y)<BR>
<= delta(s,u)<BR>
<= d[u]<BR>
<P>
Now both y and u were in V-S when u was chosen,
so d[u] <= d[y].<P>
Thus the two inequalities must be equalities,<BR>
d[y] = delta(s,y) = delta(s,u) = d[u]
<P>So d[u] = delta(s,u) contradicting our hypothesis.
<P>
Thus when each u was inserted,
d[u] = delta(s,u).
<P>
