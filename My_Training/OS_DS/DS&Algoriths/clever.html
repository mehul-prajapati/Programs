<body>
Despite having been designed before 1972
(Kernighan and Ritchie's original text appeared in 1972),
C was not standardised until 1992.
<p>
It is now formally defined in:
<p>
ANSI Standard ......
<p>An ANSI committee is working on the much harder task
of standardising C++ and a standard may be expected in
the near future.
