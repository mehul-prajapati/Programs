NAME<PRE>
     qsort - quicker sort
</PRE>
SYNOPSIS<PRE>
     qsort(base, nel, width, compar)
     char *base;
     int (*compar)();
</PRE>
DESCRIPTION<BR>
     <TT>qsort()</TT> is an implementation of the quicker-sort  algorithm.
     It sorts a table of data in place.

     <TT>base</TT> points to the element at the base of the table.  <TT>nel</TT> is
     the  number of elements in the table.  <TT>width</TT> is the size, in
     bytes, of each element in the table.  <TT>compar</TT> is the name  of
     the  comparison function, which is called with two arguments
     that point to the elements being compared.  As the  function
     must  return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than
     zero, so must the first argument to be  considered  be  less
     than, equal to, or greater than the second.
<P>
NOTES<BR>
     The pointer to the base of  the  table  should  be  of  type
     pointer-to-element, and cast to type pointer-to-character.

     The comparison function need  not  compare  every  byte,  so
     arbitrary  data may be contained in the elements in addition
     to the values being compared.

     The order in the output of two items which compare as  equal
     is unpredictable.

EXAMPLE<BR>
     The following program sorts a simple array:
<PRE>
          static    int intcompare(i,j)
          int *i, *j;
          {
               return(*i - *j);
          }

          main()
          {
               int a[10];
               int i;
               a[0] = 9;
               a[1] = 8;
               a[2] = 7;
               a[3] = 6;
               a[4] = 5;
               a[5] = 4;
               a[6] = 3;
               a[7] = 2;
               a[8] = 1;
               a[9] = 0;

               qsort(a,10,sizeof(int),intcompare)
               for (i=0; i<10; i++) printf(" %d",a[i]);
               printf("\n");
          }
