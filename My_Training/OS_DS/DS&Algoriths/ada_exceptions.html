Ada defines an <TT><FONT COLOR=green>EXCEPTION</FONT></TT> which may be processed in an
exception handler at any level in the program above that where the
exception was generated or <TT><FONT COLOR=green>RAISE</FONT></TT>d.
<FONT COLOR=green><PRE>PACKAGE adtX IS
    TYPE X IS PRIVATE;
    EXCEPTION out_of_range;

    PROCEDURE f( a: INOUT X; b: INTEGER );
END adtX;

    PROCEDURE f( a: INOUT X; b: INTEGER ) IS
        BEGIN
        ......
        IF b < some_limit THEN
            -- Normal processing

        END IF;

This package exports the exception <TT><FONT COLOR=green>out_of_range</FONT></TT>
which may be caught in any routine that uses <TT><FONT COLOR=green>f</FONT></TT>.
<FONT COLOR=green><PRE>
WITH adtX; USE adtX;  -- Import adtX

PROCEDURE g( ... ) IS
    
    BEGIN
    ...
    f( a, n );   -- Invoke method f
    ...          -- Continue here if exception not raised

    ....         -- Return from here if no errors
    EXCEPTION
        WHEN out_of_range =>
            ...  -- process the exception
    END g;
</PRE></FONT>
In this example, the exception was processed in the
procedure, <TT><FONT COLOR=green>g</FONT></TT>, which called the function, 
<TT><FONT COLOR=green>f</FONT></TT>, in which it was raised.
The code processing the exception is any set of Ada
statements: it could even raise another exception.
<P>
If the exception is not 'caught' it is propagated
up the call stack until it encounters an 
exception handler prepared to process it.
(If there are no exception handlers, then it
will propagate to the highest level and cause the
program to abort. However an implementation would be
expected to print out the name of the exception 
causing the abort.)
<P>
Because they are propagated to arbitrarily high levels
of an Ada program,
it is easy to arrange for Ada exceptions to be caught
at some level where there is an appropriate interface
for dealing with them.
For example, in a GUI program, 
the routines which handle interaction with a user through
the windows, mouse events, keyboard input, etc, are
generally at the highest level in the program.
These routines "know" how to pop up the alert box
that tells the user that a problem has occurred
and force him or her to take some action to correct
the problem.
Alternatively, in an embedded processor,
they would "know" to send a message via 
a communications channel to some master processor.
<P>
Lower level, re-usable code should be able to function
correctly in any environment - GUI, text terminal, 
embedded system, etc.
Ada's ability to propagate exceptions to a level at
which the program knows sufficient about the environment
to output the appropriate messages
makes life simple for the writer of re-usable software.
Exceptions are defined which correspond to all the
errors that could occur.
Re-usable code simply raises the exceptions.
The users of the code then have the flexibility to decide
when (<I>ie</I> at what level) to process the exceptions.
<P>
An added benefit of Ada's exception mechanism is that
it provides a uniform method of handling errors.
Left to their own devices, programmers are able to define a
large grab-bag of styles of error raising
and processing, for example,
we can:
<UL>
<LI> use the return values of functions,
<LI> add a call-by-reference error parameter to a function,
<LI> set a global variable,
<LI> call an error handling module,
<LI> notify a separate process,
<LI> ...
</UL>
In Ada, a disciplined group of programmers will use
Ada's in-built exception handling uniformly to propagate
exceptions to some agreed level in programs where 
code which "knows" the current environment can
handle the problem appropriately.
<P>
Ada further standardises behaviour by pre-defining a
number of exceptions for commonly encountered problems,
such as <TT><FONT COLOR=green>constraint_error</FONT></TT> when 
an attempt is made to assign a value to
a variable is outside the permitted range for its type.
