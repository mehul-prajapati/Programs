ASSERT(3V)             C LIBRARY FUNCTIONS             ASSERT(3V)

NAME
     assert - program verification

SYNOPSIS
     #include &lt;assert.h&gt;

     assert(expression)

DESCRIPTION
     assert() is a macro that indicates <B>expression</B> is expected to
     be  true  at  this  point  in the program.  If <B>expression</B> is
     false (0), it displays a diagnostic message on the  standard
     output  and exits (see exit(2V)).  Compiling with the cc(1V)
     option -DNDEBUG, or placing the preprocessor control  state-
     ment

          #define NDEBUG

     before the  ``#include  &lt;assert.h&gt;''  statement  effectively
     deletes assert() from the program.

SYSTEM V DESCRIPTION
     The System V version of assert() calls abort(3) rather  than
     exit().

SEE ALSO
     cc(1V), exit(2V), abort(3)

DIAGNOSTICS

          <B>n</B> of source file <B>f</B> was false.
