Another way of storing data is in a stack.
A stack is generally
implemented with only two principle operations (apart from a constructor and
destructor methods):
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=3>
<TR>
<TD><FONT COLOR=green><TT>push</tt></FONT></TD>
	<TD>adds an item to a stack</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><FONT COLOR=green><TT>pop</tt></FONT></TD>
	<TD>extracts the most recently pushed item from the stack</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
Other methods such as
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=3>
<TR>
<TD><FONT COLOR=green><TT>top</tt></FONT></TD>
<TD>returns the item at the top <i>without removing it</i>
<a href="notes.html#note9">[9]</a></TD>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD><FONT COLOR=green><tt>isempty</tt></FONT></TD>
	<TD>determines whether the stack has anything in it</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
are sometimes added.

<TD>A common model of a stack is a
plate or coin stacker.
Plates are "pushed" onto to the top and "popped" off the top.
<P>
Stacks form Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) queues and have many applications from the
parsing of algebraic expressions to ...

A formal specification of a stack class would look like:
<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR=green>typedef struct t_stack *stack;

stack ConsStack( int max_items, int item_size );
/* Construct a new stack
   Pre-condition: (max_items &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (item_size &gt; 0)
   Post-condition: returns a pointer to an empty stack
*/

void Push( stack s, void *item );
/* Push an item onto a stack
   Pre-condition: (s is a stack created by a call to ConsStack) &amp;&amp;
                  (existing item count &lt; max_items) &amp;&amp;
                  (item != NULL)
   Post-condition: item has been added to the top of s
*/

void *Pop( stack s );
/* Pop an item of a stack
   Pre-condition: (s is a stack created by a call to 
                  ConsStack) &amp;&amp;
                  (existing item count &gt;= 1)
   Post-condition: top item has been removed from s
*/

Points to note:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI> A stack is simply another collection of data items and thus it would be
possible to use exactly the same specification as the one used for our general
collection. However, collections with the LIFO semantics of stacks are so
important in computer science that it is appropriate to set up a limited
specification appropriate to stacks only.
<LI> Although a linked list implementation of a stack is possible
<NOTE>(adding and deleting from the head of a linked list produces exactly
the LIFO semantics of a stack)</NOTE>,
the most common applications for stacks have a space
restraint so that using an array implementation is a natural and efficient
one
<NOTE>(In most operating systems, allocation and de-allocation of memory is a
relatively expensive operation, there is a penalty for the flexibility of
linked list implementations.</NOTE>).

<H3> <a name="stack-frames">3.3.1 Stack Frames </a></h3>

Almost invariably, programs compiled from modern high level languages (even C!)
make use of a stack frame for the working memory of each procedure or function
invocation. When any procedure or function is called, a number of words - the
stack frame - is pushed onto a program stack. When the procedure or function
returns, this frame of data is popped off the stack.
<P>
As a function calls
 another function, first its arguments, then the
return address and finally space for local variables is pushed onto the stack.
Since each function runs in its own "environment" or 
<FONT COLOR+"#fa0000"><B>context</B></FONT>,
it becomes
possible for a function to call itself - a technique known as <i>recursion</i>.
This capability is extremely useful and extensively used - because many
problems are elegantly specified or solved in a recursive way.
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="fig/stackframe.gif" ALIGN=left></TD>
<TD>Program stack after executing a pair of mutually recursive functions:
<PRE><FONT COLOR=green>function f(int x, int y) {
    int a;
    if ( term_cond ) return ...;
    a = .....;
    return g(a);
    }

function g(int z) {
    int p,q;
    p = ...; q = ...;
    return f(p,q);
    }
</FONT></PRE>
Note how all of function 
<FONT COLOR=green><TT>f</TT></FONT>
and <FONT COLOR=green><TT>g</TT></FONT>'s environment
(their parameters and local
variables) are found in the stack frame.
When 
<FONT COLOR=green><TT>f</TT></FONT>
is called a second time from
<FONT COLOR=green><TT>g</TT></FONT>, a new frame for the second
invocation of 
<FONT COLOR=green><TT>f</TT></FONT>
is created.</TD>
