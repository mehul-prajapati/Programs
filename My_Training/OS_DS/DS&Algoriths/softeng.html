<a name=discipline></a>
The discipline of <em>Software Engineering</em> was
founded when it was discovered that large numbers of
software projects
<UL>
<li>exceeded their budgets
<li>were late
<li>were riddled with errors and
<li>did not satisfy their users' needs.
</UL>
The term is believed to have been coined by a NATO study group in 1967.
The first software engineering conference was the
NATO Software Engineering Conference held in Garmisch, Germany in 1968.

One of the classic early texts is Boehm's book:<br>
B.J. Boehm, "Software Engineering Economics", Prentice-Hall, 1981<br>

<a name=risks><H2>The Risks Forum</H2></a>
A continuing saga of problems with software system
is chronicled in the "Risks" section of ACM journal,
"Software Engineering Notes".
The Risks section has appeared in <i>every</i> issue for
more than ten years,
<I>i.e.</I> there has been no shortage of material to keep it alive
for all that time!

<h3>Clever programming</h3>

Be the end of this course, you should understand that
hacking is far from clever:
there are much more effective strategies for making
programs run faster!<p>
