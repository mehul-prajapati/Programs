Djikstra's algorithm (named after its discover,
<A HREF=e_w_dijkstra.html>E.W. Dijkstra</A>) solves the
problem of finding the shortest path from a point in
a graph (the <I>source</I>) to a destination.
It turns out that one can find the shortest paths from
a given source to <I>all</I> points in a graph in the
same time, 
hence this problem is sometimes called the
<FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>single-source shortest paths</B></FONT> problem.
<FONT COLOR=blue><BLOCKQUOTE>
The somewhat unexpected result that <I>all</I> the
paths can be found as easily as one further 
demonstrates the value of reading the literature
on algorithms!
</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
<P>

This problem is related to the spanning tree one.
The graph representing all the paths from one vertex
to all the others must be a spanning tree
- it must include all vertices.
There will also be no cycles as a cycle would define more
than one path from the selected vertex to at least one other vertex.

For a graph,<BR>

Dijkstra's algorithm keeps two sets of vertices:
<CENTER>
<TABLE WIDTH=80%>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>S</B></TD>
<TD>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD>the set of vertices whose shortest paths from the
source have already been determined <I>and</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=top> <B>V-S</B></TD>
<TD>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD>the remaining vertices.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
The other data structures needed are:
<CENTER>
<TABLE WIDTH=80%>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>d</B></TD>
<TD> array of best estimates of shortest path to each vertex </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>pi</B></TD>
<TD>an array of <A HREF=dij_pred.html>predecessors</A> for 
each vertex </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
The basic mode of operation is:
<OL>
<LI> Initialise <B>d</B> and <B>pi</B>,
<LI> Set <B>S</B> to empty,
<LI> While there are still vertices in <B>V-S</B>,
<OL TYPE=i>
<LI> Sort the vertices in <B>V-S</B> according to the current best estimate
of their distance from the source,
<LI> Add <B>u</B>, the closest vertex in <B>V-S</B>, to <B>S</B>,
<LI> <B><FONT COLOR="#fa0000">Relax</FONT></B> all the vertices still in <B>V-S</B>
connected to <B>u</B>
</OL>
</OL>
<P>

<H4>Relaxation</H4>

The <B>relaxation</B> process updates the costs of all the
vertices, <B>v</B>, connected to a vertex, <B>u</B>, if 
we could improve the best estimate of the shortest path to
<B>v</B> by including <B>(u,v)</B> in the path to <B>v</B>.
<P>
The relaxation procedure proceeds as follows:
<FONT COLOR=green><PRE>initialise_single_source( Graph g, Node s )
   for each vertex v in Vertices( g )
       g.d[v] := infinity
       g.pi[v] := nil
   g.d[s] := 0;
</PRE></FONT>

This sets up the graph so that each node has no predecessor
(<B>pi[v] = nil</B>) and the estimates of the cost (distance) of
each node from the source (<B>d[v]</B>) are infinite, except for
the source node itself (<B>d[s] = 0</B>).
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE WIDTH=80% BORDER=1>
<TD>
Note that we have also introduced a further way to store
a graph (or part of a graph - as this structure can only 
store a spanning tree),
the <FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>predecessor sub-graph</B></FONT>
- the list of predecessors of each node,
<P>
<CENTER><B>pi[j], 1 <= j <= |V|</B></CENTER>
<P>
The edges in the predecessor sub-graph are <B>(pi[v],v)</B>.
</TD>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
The relaxation procedure checks whether the current
best estimate of the shortest distance to <B>v</B>
(<B>d[v]</B>) can be improved by going through <B>u</B> (<I>i.e.</I>
by making <B>u</B> the predecessor of <B>v</B>):
<FONT COLOR=green><PRE>relax( Node u, Node v, double w[][] )
    if d[v] > d[u] + w[u,v] then
       d[v] := d[u] + w[u,v]
       pi[v] := u
</PRE></FONT>
The algorithm itself is now:
<FONT COLOR=green><PRE>shortest_paths( Graph g, Node s )
    initialise_single_source( g, s )
    S := { 0 }        /* Make S empty */
    Q := Vertices( g ) /* Put the vertices in a PQ */
    while not Empty(Q) 
        u := ExtractCheapest( Q );
        AddNode( S, u ); /* Add u to S */
        for each vertex v in Adjacent( u )
            relax( u, v, w )
</PRE></FONT>

<A NAME=dijkstra_anim>
<H3>Animation</H3>

In this animation, a number of cases have been selected to show all
aspects of the operation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
Start by selecting the data set (or you can just work through the
first one - which appears by default). 
Then select either step or run to execute the algorithm.
Note that it starts by assigning a weight of infinity to all nodes,
and then selecting a source and assigning a weight of zero to it.
As nodes are added to the set for which shortest paths are known, their
colour is changed to red.
When a node is selected, the weights of its neighbours are relaxed ..
nodes turn green and flash as they are being relaxed. 
Once all nodes are relaxed, their predecessors are updated, arcs
are turned green when this happens.
The cycle of selection, weight relaxation and predecessor update
repeats itself until all the shortest path to all nodes has been found.
