If a problem has an <B>O(n<SUP>k</SUP>)</B> time algorithm 
(where <B>k</B> is a constant), then we class it 
as having 
<FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>polynomial time complexity</B></FONT>
and as being efficiently solvable.
<P>
If there is no known polynomial time algorithm, then the problem is classed as 
<FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>intractable</B></FONT>.
<P>
The dividing line is not always obvious. 
<A NAME=euler></A>
Consider two apparently similar problems:
<CENTER>
<TABLE WIDTH=80%>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>Euler's problem</B> <BR>
(often characterized as the Bridges of 
K&ouml;nigsberg - a popular 18th C puzzle)</TD>
<TD>asks whether there is a path through a graph which 
traverses each edge only once.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top>
<B>Hamilton's problem</B></TD>
<TD> asks whether there is a path through a 
graph which visits each vertex exactly once.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<H3>Euler's problem</H3>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC=fig/konigsberg.gif></TD>
<TD>The 18th century German city of K&ouml;nigsberg  was situated on the river Pregel. 
Within a park built on the banks of the river, there were two islands joined by seven 
bridges.
<P>
The puzzle asks whether it is possible to take a tour through the park,
crossing each bridge only once.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE> 
<P> 
An exhaustive search requires starting at every possible point and traversing all the 
possible paths from that point - an <B>O(n!)</B> problem. 
However Euler showed that an 
<FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>Eulerian path</B></FONT> existed <I>iff</I>
<UL>
<LI>it is possible to go from any vertex to any other by following 
the edges (the graph must be connected) <I>and</I>
<LI>every vertex must have an even number of edges connected 
to it, with at most two exceptions (which constitute the 
starting and ending points).
</UL>
It is easy to see that these are necessary conditions: 
to complete the tour, one needs to enter 
and leave every point except the start and end points.
The proof that these are sufficient 
conditions may be found in the literature . 
Thus we now have a <B>O(n)</B> problem to determine 
whether a path exists.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Transform the map into a graph in which<BR>
the nodes represent the "dry land" points<BR>
and the arcs represent the bridges.<BR>
<IMG SRC=fig/euler.gif><BR>
</TD>
<TD>We can now easily see that the Bridges of K&ouml;nigsberg does not have a solution.<P>
A quick inspection shows that it does have a Hamiltonian path. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=red>However there is no 
known efficient algorithm for determining whether a Hamiltonian path exists.</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
But if a path was found, then it can be verified to be a solution in polynomial time: 
we simply verify that each edge in the path is actually an edge 
(<B>O(e)</B> if the edges are stored in an adjacency matrix) 
and that each vertex is visited only once (<B>O(n<SUP>2</SUP>)</B> in the worst case).
<P>
<H3>Classes P and NP</H3>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="30%">
Euler's problem lies in the <FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>class P</B></FONT>:
problems solvable in Polynomial time. 
Hamilton's problem is <I>believed</I>
to lie in <FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>class NP</B></FONT> (Non-deterministic Polynomial).
<P>
Note that I wrote "believed" in the previous sentence. 
No-one has succeeded in proving that efficient (<I>ie</I> polynomial time)
algorithms <B>don't</B> exist yet!
</TD><TD BGCOLOR="#ffffcc">

<H4>What does NP mean?</H4>

At each step in the algorithm,
you <B>guess</B> which possibility to try next.
This is the non-deterministic part: it doesn't matter which possibility
you try next.
There is no information used from previous attempts
(other than not trying something that you've already tried)
to determine which alternative should be tried next.
However, having made a guess, you can determine in polynomial
time whether it is a solution or not.
<P>
Since nothing from previous trials helps you to determine which
alternative should be tried next, 
you are forced to investigate <B>all</B> possibilities to find
a solution.
So the only systematic thing you can do is use some strategy for
systematically working through all possibilities, 
<I>eg</I> setting out all permutations of the cities for the
travelling salesman's tour.

</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Many other problems lie in <B>class NP</B>. Some examples follow.

<H4>Composite Numbers</H4>

Determining whether a number can be written as the product 
of two other numbers is the composite numbers problem.
If a solution is found, it is simple to verify it, but no efficient 
method of finding the solution exists.
<H4>Assignment</H4>
Assignment of compatible room-mates: assume we have a number of students to be 
assigned to rooms in a college. They can be represented as the vertices on a graph with 
edges linking compatible pairs. If we have two per room, a class P algorithm exists, but if 
three are to be fitted in a room, we have a class NP problem.
<H4>Boolean satisfiability</H4>
Given an arbitrary boolean expression in <B>n</B> variables:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>a<SUB>1</SUB></B> <I>op</I>
<B>a<SUB>2</SUB></B> <I>op</I> ...
<I>op</I> <B>a<SUB>n</SUB></B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <I>op</I> are boolean operators, <I>and</I>, <I>or</I>, ..
<P>
Can we find an assignment of (<I>true</I>,<I>false</I>) to the
<B>a<SUB>i</SUB></B> so that the expression is <I>true</I>?
This problem is equivalent to the <B>circuit-satisfiability problem</B>
which asks can we find a set of inputs which will produce a <I>true</I>
at the output of a circuit composed of arbitrary logic gates.
<P>
A solution can only be found by trying <B>all</B> 2<SUP>n</SUP> possible
assignments.

<H4>Map colouring</H4>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>
The three-colour map colouring problem asks if we can colour a map so that no 
adjoining countries have the same colour. 
Once a solution has been guessed, then it is 
readily proved. 
<P>[This problem is easily answered if there are only 2 colours - there must be 
no point at which an odd number of countries meet - or 4 colours - there is a proof that 4 
colours suffice for any map.]</TD>
<TD><IMG SRC=fig/map.gif></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>This problem has a graph equivalent: 
each vertex represents a country and an edge 
is drawn between two vertices if they share a common border.
<P>	
Its solution has a more general application. 
If we are scheduling work in a factory: 
each vertex can represent a task to be performed - they are linked by an edge if they share a 
common resource, <I>eg</I> require a particular machine. 
A colouring of the vertices with 3 colours then provides a 3-shift schedule for the factory.
<P>
Many problems are reducible to others: map colouring can be reduced to graph 
colouring. 
A solution to a graph colouring problem is effectively a solution to the 
equivalent map colouring or scheduling problem.
The map or graph-colouring problem may be reduced to the boolean satisfiability
problem.
To give an informal description of this process,
assume the three colours are red, blue and green.
Denote the partial solution, "A is red" by <B>a<SUB>r</SUB></B> so that we have
a set of boolean variables:
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=5><TR>
<TD><B>a<SUB>r</SUB></B></TD><TD>A is red</TD>
</TR>
<TD><B>a<SUB>b</SUB></B></TD><TD>A is blue</TD></TR>
<TD><B>a<SUB>g</SUB></B></TD><TD>A is green</TD></TR>
<TD><B>b<SUB>r</SUB></B></TD><TD>B is red</TD></TR>
<TD><B>b<SUB>b</SUB></B></TD><TD>B is blue</TD></TR>
<TD><B>b<SUB>g</SUB></B></TD><TD>B is green</TD></TR>
<TD><B>c<SUB>r</SUB></B></TD><TD>C is red</TD></TR>
<TD HALIGN=center>...</TD><TD HALIGN=center>...</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
Now a solution to the problem may be found by finding values for
<B>a<SUB>r</SUB></B>,
<B>a<SUB>b</SUB></B>,
<I>etc</I> which make the expression true:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
((<B>a<SUB>r</SUB></B> <I>and</I>
<I>not</I> <B>a<SUB>b</SUB></B> <I>and</I>
<I>not</I> <B>a<SUB>g</SUB></B>)
<I>and</I> (
(<B>b<SUB>b</SUB></B> <I>and</I>
(<B>c<SUB>b</SUB></B> <I>and</I>
(<B>d<SUB>g</SUB></B> ....
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Thus solving the map colouring problem is equivalent to finding an
assignment to the variables which results in a <I>true</I> value for 
the expression - the boolean satisfiability problem.
<P>
There is a special class of problems in <B>NP</B>: the <B>NP-complete</B> problems. 
All the problems in <B>NP</B> are efficiently reducible to them. 
By efficiently, we mean in polynomial time, 
so the term polynomially reducible provides a more precise definition.
<P>
In 1971, Cook was able to prove that the boolean satisfiability problem was <B>NP-complete</B>.
Proofs now exist showing that many problems in <B>NP</B> are efficiently reducible 
to the satisfiability problem. 
Thus we have a large class of problems which will are all 
related to each other: finding an efficient solution to one will result in an efficient solution 
for them all.
<P>
An efficient solution has so far eluded a very large number of researchers but there 
is also no proof that these problems cannot be solved in polynomial time,
so the search continues.

<P>
Class <B>NP</B> problems are solvable by non-deterministic algorithms: these algorithms 
consist of deterministic steps alternating with non-deterministic steps in which a random 
choice (a guess) must be made.
A deterministic algorithm must, given a possible solution,
<UL>
<LI> have at least one set of guessing steps which lead to the 
acceptance of that solution, and
<LI> always reject an invalid solution.
</UL>
<P>
We can also view this from the other aspect: that of trying to determine a solution. 
At each guessing stage, the algorithm randomly selects another element to add to the 
solution set: this is basically building up a "game" tree. Various techniques exist for 
pruning the tree - backtracking when an invalid solution is found and trying another 
branch, but this is where the exponential time complexity starts to enter!
<H4>Travelling salesman</H4>
<A NAME=TSP></A>
It's possible to cast this problem - which is basically an optimality one, we're 
looking for the best tour - into a yes-no one also by simply asking:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can we find a tour with a cost less than <B>x</B>?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
By asking this question until we find a tour with a cost <B>x</B> for which the answer is 
provably no, we have found the optimal tour.
This problem can also be proved to be in <B>NP</B>. (It is reducible to the Hamiltonian 
circuit problem.)
<P>
Various <B>heuristics</B> have been developed to find near optimal solutions with efficient 
algorithms.
<P>
One simple approach is the find the minimum spanning tree. 
One possible tour simple traverses the MST twice. 
So we can find a tour which is at most twice as long as the 
optimum tour in polynomial time. Various heuristics can now be applied to reduce this 
tour, eg by taking shortcuts.
<P>
An algorithm due to Christofides can be shown to produce a tour which is no more 
than 50% longer than the optimal tour. 
<TABLE>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC=fig/tsp_mst.gif></TD>
<TD>
It starts with the MST and singles out all cities 
which are linked to an odd number of cities. <BR>
These are linked in pairs by a variant of the  procedure used to find compatible room-mates. 
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC=fig/tsp.gif></TD>
<TD> This can then be improved by taking shortcuts.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Another strategy which works well in practice is to divide the "map" into many 
small regions and to generate the optimum tour by exhaustive search within those small 
regions. 
A greedy algorithm can then be used to link the regions. 
While this algorithm will 
produce tours as little as 5% longer than the optimum tour in acceptable times, it is still not 
guaranteed to produce the optimal solution.
