A <I>red-black tree</I> is a binary search tree with
one extra attribute for each node: the <I>colour</I>,
which is either red or black.
We also need to keep track of the parent of each node, 
so that a red-black tree's node structure would
be:
<FONT COLOR=green><PRE>struct t_red_black_node {
    enum { red, black } colour;
    void *item;
    struct t_red_black_node *left,
                     *right,
                     *parent;
    }
</PRE></FONT>

For the purpose of this discussion,
the NULL nodes which terminate the tree are considered to
be the leaves and are coloured black.

<H4>Definition of a red-black tree</H4>

A red-black tree is a binary search tree which has the
following <I>red-black properties</I>:
<TABLE>
<TR><TD WIDTH="60%">
<OL>
<LI> Every node is either red or black.
<LI> Every leaf (NULL) is black.
<LI> If a node is red, then both its children are black.
<LI> Every simple path from a node to a descendant leaf
contains the same number of black nodes.
</OL>
</TD>
<TD><SMALL>
<OL>
<LI VALUE=3> implies that on any path from the
root to a leaf, red nodes must not be adjacent.
<BR>
However, any number of black nodes may appear in a sequence.

<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC=fig/rb_tree1a.gif></TD><TD>Basic red-black tree with the
<B>sentinel</B> nodes added.
Implementations of the red-black tree algorithms will usually include
the sentinel nodes as a convenient means of flagging that you have
reached a leaf node.<P>
They are the NULL black nodes of property 2.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The number of black nodes on any path from,
but not including, a node <B><I>x</I></B> to a leaf is
called the <I>black-height</I> of a node,
denoted <B>bh(x)</B>.

We can prove the following lemma:
<H5>Lemma</H5>
A red-black tree with <B><I>n</I></B> internal nodes has
height at most 2<B>log(<I>n</I>+1)</B>.
<BR>
<I>(For a proof, see Cormen, p 264)</I>
<P>
This demonstrates why the red-black tree is a good
search tree: it can always be searched in <B>O(log n)</B> time.

<P>
As with heaps, additions and deletions from red-black
trees destroy the red-black property, so we need to restore it.
To do this we need to look at some operations on
red-black trees.
<H4>Rotations</H4>
<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>
A rotation is a local operation
in a search tree that preserves 
<I>in-order</I> traversal key ordering.
<P>
Note that in both trees, an in-order
traversal yields:<P>
<CENTER><PRE>A x B y C</PRE></CENTER>
</TD><TD><IMG SRC="fig/rb_tree_rot.gif"></TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
The left_rotate operation may be encoded:
<FONT COLOR=green><PRE>left_rotate( Tree T, node x ) {
    node y;
    y = x->right;
    /* Turn y's left sub-tree into x's right sub-tree */
    x->right = y->left;
    if ( y->left != NULL )
        y->left->parent = x;
    /* y's new parent was x's parent */
    y->parent = x->parent;
    /* Set the parent to point to y instead of x */
    /* First see whether we're at the root */
    if ( x->parent == NULL ) T->root = y;
    else
        if ( x == (x->parent)->left )
            /* x was on the left of its parent */
            x->parent->left = y;
        else
            /* x must have been on the right */
            x->parent->right = y;
    /* Finally, put x on y's left */
    y->left = x;
    x->parent = y;
    }
</PRE></FONT>

<h4>Insertion</H4>

Insertion is somewhat complex and involves a number
of cases.
Note that we start by inserting the new node, <TT>x</TT>,
in the tree just as we would for any other binary tree,
using the <TT>tree_insert</TT> function.
This new node is labelled red, and possibly
destroys the red-black property.
The main loop moves up the tree,
restoring the red-black property.

<FONT COLOR=green><PRE>rb_insert( Tree T, node x ) {
    /* Insert in the tree in the usual way */
    tree_insert( T, x );
    /* Now restore the red-black property */
    x->colour = red;
    while ( (x != T->root) && (x->parent->colour == red) ) {
       if ( x->parent == x->parent->parent->left ) {
           /* If x's parent is a left, y is x's right 'uncle' */
           y = x->parent->parent->right;
           if ( y->colour == red ) {
               /* case 1 - change the colours */
               x->parent->colour = black;
               y->colour = black;
               x->parent->parent->colour = red;
               /* Move x up the tree */
               x = x->parent->parent;
               }
           else {
               /* y is a black node */
               if ( x == x->parent->right ) {
                   /* and x is to the right */ 
                   /* case 2 - move x up and rotate */
                   x = x->parent;
                   left_rotate( T, x );
                   }
               /* case 3 */
               x->parent->colour = black;
               x->parent->parent->colour = red;
               right_rotate( T, x->parent->parent );
               }
           }
       else {
           /* repeat the "if" part with right and left
              exchanged */
       }
    /* Colour the root black */
    T->root->colour = black;
    }

Examination of the code reveals only one
loop. 
In that loop, the node at the root of the sub-tree
whose red-black property we are trying to restore, <TT>x</TT>,
may be moved up the tree <I>at least one level</I> in each iteration
of the loop.
Since the tree originally has <B>O(log n)</B> height,
there are <B>O(log n)</B> iterations. 
The 
<FONT COLOR=green><TT>tree_insert</TT></FONT>
routine also has <B>O(log n)</B> complexity,
so overall the 
<FONT COLOR=green><TT>rb_insert</TT></FONT>
routine also has <B>O(log n)</B> complexity.
