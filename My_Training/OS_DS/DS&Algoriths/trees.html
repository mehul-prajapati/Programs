<H3>4.3.1 Binary Trees</H3>

The simplest form of tree is a 
<FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>binary tree</B></FONT>.
A binary tree consists of
<OL type="a">
<LI>a <I>node</I> (called the <FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>root</B></FONT> node) and
<LI>left and right sub-trees.<BR>
Both the sub-trees are themselves binary trees.
</OL>
<P>
You now have a <I>recursively defined data structure</I>.
(It is also possible to define a list recursively:
<A HREF=recur_list.html>can you see how?</A>)
<P>
<IMG SRC="fig/tree.gif" ALIGN=bottom><BR>
<CENTER>A binary tree</CENTER>
<P>
The nodes at the lowest levels of the tree
(the ones with no sub-trees) are called 
<FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>leaves</B></FONT>.

<P>
In an <I>ordered binary tree</I>,
<OL>
<LI>
the keys of all the nodes in the left sub-tree are 
less than that of the root,
<LI>
the keys of all the nodes in the right sub-tree are
greater than that of the root,
<LI>
the left and right sub-trees are themselves 
ordered binary trees.
</OL>

<H3>Data Structure</H3>
The data structure for the tree implementation simply
adds left and right pointers in place of the next pointer 
of the linked list implementation.
[<A HREF="source/tree_struct.c" TARGET="tree struct">Load the tree struct</A>.]
<P>
The <TT><FONT color=green>AddToCollection</FONT></TT> method
is, naturally, recursive.
[<A HREF="source/tree_add.c" TARGET="tree add">
Load the <TT>AddToCollection</TT> method</A>.]
<P>
Similarly, the
<TT><FONT color=green>FindInCollection</FONT></TT> method
is recursive.

<H3>Analysis</H3>
<H4>Complete Trees</H4>
Before we look at more general cases,
let's make the optimistic assumption that we've managed to
fill our tree neatly, <I>ie</I> that each leaf is the same
'distance' from the root.
<TABLE>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="fig/complete.gif"><BR>
<CENTER>A complete tree</CENTRE></TD>
<TD>
This forms a <I>complete tree</I>, whose <I>height</I>
is defined as the number of links from the root to the
deepest leaf.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
First, we need to work out how many nodes,
<I><B>n</B></I>,
we have in such a tree of height,
<I><B>h</B></I>.
<P>
Now,<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><B>n</B></I> = 1 + 2<SUP>1</SUP> + 2<SUP>2</SUP> + .... + 2<SUP><I><B>h</B></I></SUP><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
From which we have,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><B>n</B></I> = 2<SUP><I><B>h</B></I>+1</SUP> - 1<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
and
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><B>h</B></I> = <B>floor( log<SUB>2</SUB><I>n</I> )</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Examination of the <TT>Find</TT> method shows that in the worst case,
<I><B>h</B></I>+1 or
<B>ceiling( log<SUB>2</SUB><I>n</I> )</B> comparisons are
needed to find an item.
This is the same as for binary search.
<P>
However, <TT>Add</TT> also requires
<B>ceiling( log<SUB>2</SUB><I>n</I> )</B> comparisons 
to determine where to add an item.
Actually adding the item takes a constant number of operations,
so we say that a binary tree requires
<B>O(log<I>n</I>)</B> operations for <I>both</I>
adding and finding an item - a considerable
improvement over binary search for a <I>dynamic</I>
structure which often requires addition of new items.
<P>
Deletion is also an
<B>O(log<I>n</I>)</B> operation.

<H4>General binary trees</H4>

However, in general addition of items to an ordered tree will
not produce a complete tree.
The worst case occurs if we add an ordered list of items
to a tree.
<P>
What will happen? Think before you click
<A HREF="unbalanced.html">here</A>!
<P>
This problem is readily overcome: we use a structure 
known as a <A HREF="heaps.html">heap</A>.
However, before looking at heaps, 
we should formalise our ideas about the
complexity of algorithms by defining carefully
what <B>O(f(<I>n</I>))</B> means.

<DL>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>Root Node</B></FONT>
   <DD>Node at the "top" of a tree - the one from which all operations
       on the tree commence. The root node may not exist (a NULL tree with
       no nodes in it) or have 0, 1 or 2 children in a binary tree.
<DT><FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>Leaf Node</B></FONT>
   <DD>Node at the "bottom" of a tree - farthest from the root.
        Leaf nodes have no children.
<DT><FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>Complete Tree</B></FONT>
   <DD>Tree in which each leaf is at the same distance from the root.
	A more precise and formal definition of a <A HREF=heaps.html#complete_tree>
complete tree</A> is set out later.
<DT><FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>Height</B></FONT>
   <DD>Number of nodes which must be traversed from the root to reach
       a leaf of a tree.
