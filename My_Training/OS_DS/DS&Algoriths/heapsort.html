We noted earlier, when discussing 
<A HREF=heaps.html>heaps</A>,
that, as well as their use in priority queues,
they provide a means of sorting:
<OL>
<LI> construct a heap,
<LI> add each item to it (maintaining the heap property!),
<LI> when all items have been added,
remove them one by one (restoring the heap property as
each one is removed).
</OL>
Addition and deletion are both <B>O(log<I>n</I>)</B>
operations. We need to perform <B><I>n</I></B> 
additions and deletions, leading to an
<B>O(<I>n</I>log<I>n</I>)</B> algorithm.

We will look at another efficient sorting 
algorithm,
<A HREF=qsort.html>Quicksort</A>,
and then compare it with Heap sort.


<H3>Animation</H3>

The following animation uses a slight modification of the above approach
to sort directly using a heap.
You will note that it places <B>all</B> the items into the array
first, <B>then</B> takes items at the bottom of the heap and restores
the heap property, rather than restoring the heap property as
<B>each</B> item is entered as the algorithm above suggests.
(This approach is described more fully in Cormen <I>et al.</I>)
<P>
Note that the animation shows the data 
<UL><LI>stored in an array (as it is in the implementation of the
        algorithm) <I>and also</I>
    <LI>in the tree form - so that the heap structure can be clearly
        seen.
</UL>
Both representations are, of course, equivalent.
