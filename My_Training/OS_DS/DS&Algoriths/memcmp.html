MEMORY(3)              C LIBRARY FUNCTIONS              MEMORY(3)

NAME
     memory, memccpy, memchr, memcmp,  memcpy,  memset  -  memory
     operations

SYNOPSIS
     #include &lt;memory.h&gt;

     <I>... others omitted ...</I>

     int memcmp(s1, s2, n)
     char *s1, *s2;
     int n;

DESCRIPTION
     These functions operate as efficiently as possible on memory
     areas  (arrays  of  characters  bounded by a count, not ter-
     minated by a null character).  They do  not  check  for  the
     overflow of any receiving memory area.

     memcmp() compares its arguments,  looking  at  the  first  <B>n</B>
     characters only, and returns an integer less than, equal to,
     or greater than 0, according as <B>s1</B> is lexicographically less
     than, equal to, or greater than <B>s2</B>.

     <I>See full man page for other descriptions.</I>

NOTES
     For user convenience, all these functions  are  declared  in
     the &lt;memory.h&gt; header file.
