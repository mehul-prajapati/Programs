Fourier transforms have wide application in scientific and
engineering problems,
for example, they are extensively used in signal processing to
transform a signal from the time domain to the frequency 
domain.
<P>
Here, we will use them to generate an efficient solution to
an apparently unrelated problem - that of multiplying two
polynomials.
Apart from demonstrating how the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT)
algorithm calculates a Discrete Fourier Transform and
deriving its time complexity,
this approach is designed to reinforce the
following points:
<UL>
<LI> 'Better' solutions are known to many problems
for which, intuitively, it would not appear possible to
find a better solution.
<LI> As a consequence,
unless you have read extensively in any problem area
already, 
you should consult the literature before attempting to
solve any numerical or data processing problem
presented to you.
