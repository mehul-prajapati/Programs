<H3>Naive Solutions</H3>

A naive program attempting to play a game like chess will:
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> Determine the number of moves which can be made from the current position,
<LI> For each of these moves,
<OL TYPE=i>
<LI> Apply the move to the current position,
<LI> Calculate a "score" for the new position,
<LI> If the maximum search "depth" has been reached, 
       return with this score as the score for this move,
<LI> else recursively call the program with the new position.
</OL>
<LI> Choose the move with the best score and return its score
     and the move generating it to the calling routine.
</OL>
Because there are usually at least 20 possible moves from any given chess
position, to search to a depth of <B>m</B> requires ~20<SUP>m</SUP></B>
moves.
Since good human players usually look 10 or more moves ahead,
the simple algorithm would severely tax the capabilities of even the
fastest modern computer.
<P>
However, with a little cunning, the number of moves which needs to be
searched can be dramatically reduced - enabling a computer to search
deeper in a reasonable time and, as recent events have shown, 
enable a computer to finally be a match for even the best human players.

<H3>Alpha-Beta Algorithm</H3>

The Alpha-Beta algorithm reduces the number of moves which need to be
explored by "cutting off" regions of the game tree which cannot produce
a better result than has already been obtained in some part of the 
tree which has already been searched.
