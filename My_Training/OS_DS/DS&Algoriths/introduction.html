This course is designed to teach you how to program efficiently.
It assumes that 
<UL>
<LI>you know the basics of programming in C,
<LI>can write, debug and run simple programs in C, and
<LI>have some simple understanding of object-oriented design.
</UL>
An introduction to object-oriented programming using ANSI
standard C may be found in the companion 
<A HREF=../../Year1/CLP110/CLP_ToC.html>Object First</A>
course.

    <I>What does <FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>correct</B></FONT> mean?</I><P>
    We need to have some formal notion of the meaning of correct:
    thus we define it to mean
     <TABLE CELLPADDING=6>
     <TR><TD>
     "run in accordance with the specifications".
     </TD></TR></TABLE>
    </TD></TR></TABLE>

The first of these is obvious - programs which don't run correctly 
are clearly of little use. "Efficiently"
is usually understood to mean in the minimum time - but occasionally there will
be other constraints, such as memory use, which will be paramount. As will be
demonstrated later, better running times will generally be obtained from use of
the most appropriate data structures and 
<FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>algorithms</B></FONT>, rather than through "hacking", i.e.
removing a few statements by some <a href="softeng.html#clever">clever coding</a> -
or even worse, programming in assembler!
<P>
This course will focus on solving problems efficiently:
you will be introduced to a number of fundamental data structures
and algorithms (or procedures) for manipulating them.

The importance of the other points is
less obvious.
The early history of many computer installations is, however,
testimony to their importance.
Many studies have quantified the enormous costs
of failing to build software systems that had all the characteristics listed.
(A classic reference is <a href=softeng.html#boehm>Boehm's text</a>.)
Unfortunately, much recent evidence suggests that these principles are still
not well understood! 
Any perusal of <a href="softeng.html#risks">Risks</a> forum will soon
convince you that there is an enormous amount of poor software in use.
The discipline of <a href="softeng.html#discipline"><i>software engineering</i></a>
is concerned with building large software systems which perform as their users
expected, are reliable and easy to maintain.
This course will introduce some 
software engineering principles but we will concentrate on the creation of
small programs only.
By using well-known, efficient techniques for solving problems,
not only do you produce correct and fast programs in the minimum
time,
but you make your programs easier to modify.
Another software engineer will find it much simpler to work with
a well-known solution than something that has been hacked together
and "looks a bit like" some textbook algorithm.
