<h2>C hacks</h2>

C allows you to define a <TT><FONT COLOR=green>void</FONT></TT>
pointer. This pointer will match a pointer to <I>any</I> type.
When you invoke a function whose formal parameter is a 
<TT><FONT COLOR=green>void *</FONT></TT>,
you can use any pointer as the actual argument.
<P>
This allows you to build generic functions which will operate
on a variety of data types.
However it does bypass the compiler's type checking - 
and allow you to inadvertently make mistakes that
a compiler for a
<FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>strongly typed</B></FONT>
language such as Ada
would detect for you.

<h2>Hacking</h2>
This term probably arises from the MIT expression
for what we know in English as a "student prank".
MIT students refer to
these assaults on the conventions of society as
"hacks".
