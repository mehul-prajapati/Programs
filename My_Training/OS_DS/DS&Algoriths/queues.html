Queues are dynamic collections which have some concept of
order.
This can be either based on order of entry into the queue -
giving us First-In-First-Out (FIFO) or Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
queues.
Both of these can be built with linked lists:
the simplest "add-to-head" implementation of a linked list
gives LIFO behaviour.
A minor modification - adding a tail pointer and adjusting
the addition method implementation - will produce
a FIFO queue.
<P>

<H3>Performance</H3>

A straightforward analysis shows that for both these cases,
the time needed to add or delete an item is constant and
<I>independent of the number of items in the queue</I>.
Thus we class both addition and deletion as an
<B><I>O</I>(1)</B>
operation. 
For any given real machine+operating system+language combination,
addition may take <B><I>c<SUB>1</SUB></I></B> seconds and
deletion <B><I>c<SUB>2</SUB></I></B> seconds,
but we aren't interested in the
value of the constant, it will vary from machine to
machine, language to language, <I>etc</I>.
The key point is that the time is not dependent on <B><I>n</I></B>
- producing 
<B><I>O</I>(1)</B>
algorithms.
<P>
Once we have written an
<B><I>O</I>(1)</B> method,
there is generally little more that we can do
from an algorithmic point of view.
Occasionally, a better approach may produce a
lower constant time.
Often, enhancing our compiler, run-time system, machine,
<I>etc</I> will produce some significant improvement.
However
<B><I>O</I>(1)</B> methods are already very fast,
and it's unlikely that effort expended in 
improving such a method will produce much real gain!
<P>
<A NAME=priority>
<H3>5.1 Priority Queues</H3>
Often the items added to a queue have a <I><FONT COLOR=red>priority 
</FONT></I>
associated with them:
this priority determines the order in which they
exit the queue - highest priority items are removed
first. 
<P>
This situation arises often in process control systems.
Imagine the operator's console in a large automated
factory.
It receives many routine messages from all parts of
the system: they are assigned a low priority because
they just report the normal functioning of the system -
they update various parts of the operator's console display
simply so that there is some confirmation that
there are no problems.
It will make little difference if they are delayed or lost.
<P>
However, occasionally something breaks or fails and
alarm messages are sent.
These have high priority because some action is required
to fix the problem (even if it is mass evacuation because
nothing can stop the imminent explosion!).
<P>
Typically such a system will be composed of many small
units, one of which will be a buffer for messages
received by the operator's console.
The communications system places messages in the buffer
so that communications links can be freed for further
messages while the console software is processing the
message.
The console software extracts messages from the buffer
and updates appropriate parts of the display system.
Obviously we want to sort messages on their priority so
that we can ensure that the alarms are processed immediately
and not delayed behind a few thousand routine messages
while the plant is about to explode.
<P>
As we have seen, we could use a tree structure -
which generally provides 
<B><I>O</I>(log<I>n</I>)</B>
performance for both insertion and deletion.
Unfortunately, if the tree becomes unbalanced,
performance will degrade to
<B><I>O(n)</I></B>
in pathological cases.
This will probably not be acceptable
when dealing with dangerous industrial processes,
nuclear reactors, flight control systems and
other <I>life-critical</I> systems.

<H4>Aside</H4>
The great majority of computer systems would fall into
the broad class of <I>information systems</I> - which 
simply store and process information for the benefit
of people who make decisions based on that information.
Obviously, in such systems, it usually doesn't matter
whether it takes 1 or 100 seconds to retrieve a piece of
data - this simply determines whether  you take your coffee
break now or later.
However, as we'll see, using the best known algorithms is
usually easy and straight-forward: if they're not already
coded in libaries, they're in text-books. 
You don't even have to work out how to code them!
In such cases, it's just your reputation that's going to
suffer if someone (who has studied
his or her algorithms text!) comes along later and says
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Why on earth did X (you!) use this
<B><I>O(n</I><SUP>2</SUP></I>)</I></B> method -<BR>
there's a well known <B><I>O(n)</I></B> one!"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, hardware manufacturers are <B>very</B> happy if
you use inefficient algorithms - it drives the demand
for new, faster hardware - and keeps their profits high!
