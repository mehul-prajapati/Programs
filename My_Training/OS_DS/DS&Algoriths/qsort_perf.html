The recursive calls in quick sort are generally expensive on most
architectures - the overhead of <I>any</I> procedure call is 
significant and reasonable improvements can be obtained with
equivalent

<P>
Two things can be done to eke a little more performance out
of your processor when sorting:
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>
Quick sort - in its usual recursive form -
has a reasonably high constant factor relative to a simpler
sort such as <A HREF=sorting.html>insertion sort</A>.
Thus, when the partitions become small (<B><I>n</I> < ~10</B>), 
a switch to insertion sort for the small partition will
usually show a measurable speed-up.
(The point at which it becomes effective to switch to
the insertion sort is extremely sensitive to architectural
features and needs to be determined for any target
processor: although a value of ~10 is a reasonable 
guess!)
<LI>
Write the whole algorithm in an iterative form.
This is left for a tutorial exercise!
