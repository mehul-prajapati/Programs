<h1>Ada</h1>
Ada was designed in response to a US Department
of Defense initiative which sought a common higher order
language for all defense applications.
<p>
Jean Ichbiah's team at Honeywell Bull won the 
competition for the new language, which was named
after Ada Augusta, daugther of Lord Byron and
Countess of Lovelace.
Ada was Babbage's assistant and thus may claim the
title of the first computer programmer.
<p>
Ada is now an ANSI and ISO standard:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language,</I><BR>
ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A-1983, Feb, 1983.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The language reference manual may also be found as an
appendix in some texts, <I>eg</I><BR>

<p>
The Ada initiative pre-dates the discovery of
object-oriented design.
However, it does support many OO design strategies.
It provides excellent support for the construction
of Abstract Data Types through use of the
package and private data type facilities.
<p>
An object oriented Ada, "Ada 95", has been defined.

An on-line version of the

Ada Language Reference Manual</A>
is available.
It is also available from a number of other sites: any 
Internet search engine should be able to locate the nearest one
for you.
