<P>
 
 Assume that
 <OL> 
 <LI> the keys of the items that we wish to
 sort lie in a small fixed range and 
 <LI> that there is
 only one item with each value of the key.
 </OL>
 Then we can sort with the following procedure:
 <OL>
 <LI> Set up an array of "bins" - one for each value of the key -
 in order,
 <LI> Examine each item and use the value of the key to place
 it in the appropriate bin.
 </OL>
 Now our collection is sorted and it only took <B>n</B>
 operations, so this is an <B>O(n)</B> operation.
 However, note that it will only work under very restricted
 conditions.
 <P>

<H4>Constraints on bin sort</H4>

To understand these restrictions,
let's be a little more precise about the specification of the
 problem and assume that there are <B>m</B> values of the
 key. To recover our sorted collection, we need to examine each
 bin.
 This adds a third step to the algorithm above,
<OL START=3>
<LI> Examine each bin to see whether there's an item in it.
</OL>
which requires 
 <B>m</B> operations. So the algorithm's time becomes:
 <CENTER>
 <B>T(n) = c<SUB>1</SUB>n + c<SUB>2</SUB>m</B>
 </CENTER>
 and it is strictly <B>O(n + m)</B>.
 Now if <B>m &lt;= n</B>, this is clearly <B>O(n)</B>.
 However if <B>m &gt;&gt; n</B>, then it is <B>O(m)</B>.
 <P>
 For example, if we wish to sort 10<SUP>4</SUP> 32-bit integers,
 then <B>m</B> = 2<SUP>32</SUP> and we need 2<SUP>32</SUP> operations
 (and a rather large memory!).
 <BR>
 For <B>n</B> = 10<SUP>4</SUP>:<BR>
 <CENTER>
<B>nlogn</B> &#126; 10<SUP>4</SUP> x 13 &#126; 2<SUP>13</SUP> x 2<SUP>4</SUP>
 &#126; 2<SUP>17</SUP>
</CENTER>
So quicksort or heapsort would clearly be preferred.
<P>
An implementation of bin sort might look like:
<P><FONT COLOR=green>
<PRE>#define EMPTY	-1 /* Some convenient flag */
void bin_sort( int *a, int *bin, int n ) {
    int i;
    /* Pre-condition: for 0&lt;=i&lt;n : 0 &lt;= a[i] &lt; M */
    /* Mark all the bins empty */
    for(i=0;i&lt;M;i++) bin[i] = EMPTY;
    for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++)
        bin[ a[i] ] = a[i];
    }

main() {
    int a[N], bin[M];    /* for all i: 0 &lt;= a[i] &lt; M */
    .... /* Place data in a */
    bin_sort( a, bin, N );

</PRE></FONT>
<P>
If there are duplicates, then each bin can be replaced by a linked list.
The third step then becomes:
<OL START=3>
<LI>Link all the lists into one list. 
</OL>
We can add an item to a linked list in <B>O(1)</B> time.
There are <B>n</B> items requiring <B>O(n)</B> time.
Linking a list to another list simply involves making the
tail of one list point to the other, so it is <B>O(1)</B>. 
Linking <B>m</B> such lists obviously takes <B>O(m)</B> time,
so the algorithm is still <B>O(n+m)</B>.
<P>
In contrast to the other sorts, which sort <I>in place</I> and don't 
require additional memory,
bin sort requires additional memory for the bins and is a good example of
trading space for performance.
<P>

<CENTER>Although memory tends to be cheap in modern processors - <BR>
so that we would normally use memory rather profligately to
obtain performance,<BR>
<FONT COLOR=red>memory consumes power</FONT><BR>
and in some circumstances, 
<I>eg</I> computers in space craft,<BR>
power might be a higher constraint than performance.</CENTER>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
Having highlighted this constraint, there is a version of 
bin sort which can sort in place:
<FONT COLOR=green>
<PRE>#define EMPTY	-1 /* Some convenient flag */
void bin_sort( int *a, int n ) {
    int i;
    /* Pre-condition: for 0&lt;=i&lt;n : 0 &lt;= a[i] &lt; n */
    for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++)
	if ( a[i] != i )
            SWAP( a[i], a[a[i]] );
    }
</PRE></FONT>
However, this assumes that there are <B>n</B> distinct keys
in the range 0 .. <B>n</B>-1.
In addition to this restriction, the SWAP operation is relatively
expensive, so that this version trades space for time.
<P>
The bin sorting strategy may appear rather limited,
but it can be generalised into a strategy known as
<A HREF=radixsort.html>Radix sorting</A>.
