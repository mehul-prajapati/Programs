TIME(3V)               C LIBRARY FUNCTIONS               TIME(3V)

NAME
     time, ftime - get date and time

SYNOPSIS
     #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
     #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;

     time_t time(tloc)
     time_t *tloc;

     #include &lt;sys/timeb.h&gt;

     int ftime(tp)
     struct timeb *tp;

DESCRIPTION
     time() returns the time since 00:00:00 GMT,  Jan.  1,  1970,
     measured in seconds.

     If <B>tloc</B> is non-NULL, the return value is also stored in  the
     location to which <B>tloc</B> points.

     ftime() fills in a structure pointed to by <B>tp</B>, as defined in
     &lt;sys/timeb.h&gt;:
          struct timeb
          {
               time_t   time;
               unsigned short millitm;
               short    timezone;
               short    dstflag;
          };

     The structure contains the time since the epoch in  seconds,
     up  to 1000 milliseconds of more-precise interval, the local
     time  zone  (measured  in  minutes  of  time  westward  from
     Greenwich), and a flag that, if nonzero, indicates that Day-
     light Saving time applies  locally  during  the  appropriate
     part of the year.

RETURN VALUES
     time() returns the value of time on success.  On failure, it
     returns (time_t) -1.

     On success, ftime() returns no useful value.  On failure, it
     returns -1.
