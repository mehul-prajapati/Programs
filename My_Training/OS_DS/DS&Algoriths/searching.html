Computer systems are often used to store large amounts of data from which
individual records must be retrieved according to some search criterion. Thus
the efficient storage of data to facilitate fast searching is an important
issue. In this section, we shall investigate the performance of some searching
algorithms and the data structures which they use.

<a name="seq-search">
<H2>4.1 Sequential Searches</H2>

Let's examine how long it will take to find an item matching a key in the
collections we have discussed so far. We're interested in:
<P>
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>	the average time
<LI>	the worst-case time and
<LI>	the best possible time.
</OL>
However, we will generally be most concerned with the worst-case time as
calculations based on worst-case times can lead to guaranteed performance
predictions.
Conveniently, the worst-case times are generally easier to calculate
than average times.
<P>
If there are <B><I>n</I></B> items in our collection - whether it is stored as an array or as
a linked list - then it is obvious that in the worst case, when there is no
item in the collection with the desired key, then <B><I>n</I></B> comparisons of the key with
keys of the items in the collection will have to be made.<P>
To simplify analysis and comparison of algorithms, we look for a dominant
operation and count the number of times that dominant operation has to be
performed. In the case of searching, the dominant operation is the comparison,
since the search requires n comparisons in the worst case, we say this is a
<B><I>O(n)</I></B>
<NOTE>(pronounce this "big-Oh-n" or "Oh-n")</NOTE>
algorithm.
The best case - in which the first
comparison returns a match - requires a single comparison and is <B><I>O(</I>1<I>)</I></B>.
The
average time depends on the probability that the key will be found in the
collection - this is something that we would not expect to know in the majority
of cases. Thus in this case, as in most others, estimation of the average time
is of little utility. If the performance of the system is vital, i.e. it's part
of a life-critical system, then we must use the worst case in our design
calculations as it represents the best guaranteed performance.

<a name="binary-search">
<H2>4.2 Binary Search</H2>

However, if we place our items in an array and sort them in either ascending or
descending order on the key first, then we can obtain much better performance
with an algorithm called <FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>binary search</B></FONT>.
<P>
In binary search, we first compare the key with the item in the middle position
of the array. If there's a match, we can return immediately. If the key is less
than the middle key, then the item sought must lie in the lower half of the
array; if it's greater then the item sought must lie in the upper half of the
array. So we repeat the procedure on the lower (or upper) half of the array.<P>
Our <TT><FONT COLOR=green>FindInCollection</FONT></TT>
function can now be implemented:
<P><PRE><FONT COLOR=green>
static void *bin_search( collection c, int low, int high, void *key ) {
	int mid;
	/* Termination check */
	if (low &gt; high) return NULL;
	mid = (high+low)/2;
	switch (memcmp(ItemKey(c-&gt;items[mid]),key,c-&gt;size)) {
		/* Match, return item found */
		case 0: return c-&gt;items[mid];
		/* key is less than mid, search lower half */
		case -1: return bin_search( c, low, mid-1, key);
		/* key is greater than mid, search upper half */
		case 1: return bin_search( c, mid+1, high, key );
		default : return NULL;
		}
	}

void *FindInCollection( collection c, void *key ) {
/* Find an item in a collection
   Pre-condition: 
	c is a collection created by ConsCollection
	c is sorted in ascending order of the key
	key != NULL
   Post-condition: returns an item identified by key if
   one exists, otherwise returns NULL
*/
	int low, high;
	low = 0; high = c-&gt;item_cnt-1;
	return bin_search( c, low, high, key );
}
</FONT></PRE>
Points to note:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI> <TT><FONT COLOR=green>bin_search</FONT></TT> is recursive:
it determines whether the search key lies in the lower or upper half
of the array, then calls itself on the appropriate half.
<LI> There is a termination condition (two of them in fact!)
<OL TYPE="i">
<LI> If <TT><FONT COLOR=green>low &gt; high</FONT></TT> then
the partition to be searched has no elements in it <i>and</i>
<LI> If there is a match with the element in the middle of the
current partition, then we can return immediately.
</OL>
<LI> <TT><FONT COLOR=green>AddToCollection</FONT></TT>
will need to be modified to ensure that
each item added is placed in its correct place in the array.
The procedure is simple:
<OL TYPE="i">
<LI> Search the array until the correct spot to insert the new item
is found,
<LI> Move all the following items up one position <i>and</i>
<LI> Insert the new item into the empty position thus created.
</OL>
<LI> <TT><FONT COLOR=green>bin_search</FONT></TT> is declared
<TT><FONT COLOR=green>static</FONT></TT>. 
It is a local function and is not used outside this class:
if it were not declared static, it would be exported and
be available to all parts of the program.
The static declaration also allows other classes to use the
same name internally.

<TABLE>

<IMG SRC="fig/bsearch.gif"></TD> <TD>
Each step of the algorithm divides the block of items
being searched in half.
We can divide a set of <I><B>n</B></I> items in half
at most <B>log<SUB>2</SUB> <I>n</I></B> times.
<P>
Thus the running time of a binary search is
proportional to <B>log <I>n</I></B> and we
say this is a
<B><I>O(</I>log <I>n)</I></B> 
algorithm.

</TR>
</TABLE>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>
Binary search requires a more complex program
than our original search and thus for <I>small <B>n</B></I>
it may run slower than the simple linear search.
However, for large <I><B>n</B></I>,<BR>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="fig/limit.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
Thus at large <I><B>n</B></I>,
<B>log <I>n</I></B>
is <I>much</I> smaller than <I><B>n</B></I>,
consequently an 
<B><I>O(</I>log <I>n)</I></B> 
algorithm
is <I>much</I> faster than an
<B><I>O(n)</I></B>
one.

<P>
We will examine this behaviour more formally in a
<A HREF="complexity.html">later section</A>.
First, let's see what we can do about the insertion
(<TT><FONT COLOR=green>AddToCollection</FONT></TT>)
operation.
<P>
In the worst case, insertion may require 
<I><B>n</B></I>
operations to insert into
a sorted list.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>We can find the place in the list
where the new item belongs using binary search
in
<B><I>O(</I>log <I>n)</I></B> 
operations.
<LI>However, we have to shuffle all the following items
up one place to make way for the new one.
In the worst case, the new item is the first in
the list,
requiring
<I><B>n</B></I>
move operations for the shuffle!
</UL>
<P>
A similar analysis will show that deletion is also an
<B><I>O(n)</I></B>
operation.
<P>
If our collection is static, <I>ie</I> it doesn't
change very often - if at all - then we may not be
concerned with the time required to change its contents:
we may be prepared for the initial build of
the collection and the occasional insertion and
deletion to take some time.
In return, we will be able to use a simple data structure
(an array)
which has little memory overhead.
<P>
However, if our collection is large and dynamic, <I>ie</I> items
are being added and deleted continually,
then we can obtain considerably better performance
using a data structure called a <A HREF=trees.html>tree</A>.
