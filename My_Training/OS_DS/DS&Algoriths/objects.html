In this course, we won't delve into the full theory of object-oriented design.
We'll concentrate on the pre-cursor of OO design: abstract data types (ADTs). A
theory for the full object oriented approach is readily built on the ideas for
abstract data types.<p>

An <FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>abstract data type</B></FONT>
is a data structure and a collection of functions or
procedures which operate on the data structure. <p>
To align ourselves with OO theory, we'll call the functions and procedures
<FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>methods</B></FONT>
and the data structure and its methods a 
<FONT COLOR="#fa0000"><B>class</B></FONT>,
<I>i.e.</I> we'll call our ADTs classes.
However our classes do not have the full capabilities associated with
classes in OO theory. 
An instance of the class is called an <FONT COLOR=red><i>object</i>
</FONT>.
Objects represent objects in
the real world and appear in programs as variables of a type defined by the
class. These terms have exactly the same meaning in OO design methodologies,
but they have additional properties such as inheritance that we will not
discuss here.<p>
It is important to note the object orientation is a <i>design methodology</i>.
As a consequence, it is possible to write OO programs using languages such as
C, Ada and Pascal. The so-called OO languages such as C++ and
<a href="eiffel.html">Eiffel</a> simply
provide some compiler support for OO design: this support must be provided by
the programmer in non-OO languages.

<h2><a name="collections">2.2 An Example: Collections</a></h2>

Programs often deal with collections of items. These collections may be
organised in many ways and use many different program structures to represent
them, yet, from an abstract point of view, there will be a few common
operations on any collection. These might include:

<h3>
<a name="constructors">2.2.1 Constructors and destructors
</a></h3>
The create and destroy methods - often called constructors and destructors -
are usually implemented for any abstract data type. Occasionally, the data
type's use or semantics are such that there is only ever one object of that
type in a program. In that case, it is possible to hide even the object's
`handle' from the user. However, even in these cases, constructor and
destructor methods are often provided.
<p>
Of course, specific applications may call for additional methods, e.g. we may
need to join two collections (form a union in set terminology) - or may not
need all of these.
<p><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=red>
One of the aims of good program design would be to ensure that additional
requirements are easily handled.

<A NAME=data_structure>
<H3>2.2.2 Data Structure</H3>
To construct an abstract software model of a collection, we start by building
the formal specification. The first component of this is the name of a data
type - this is the type of objects that belong to the
<tt><FONT COLOR=green>collection</FONT></tt>
<i>class</i>. In C, we use <tt><FONT COLOR=green>typedef</FONT></tt> to define a new type which is a
pointer to a structure:
<P><CENTER>
<FONT COLOR=green>
<tt>typedef struct collection_struct *collection;</tt>
</FONT></CENTER>
<p>
<tt></tt>Note that we are defining a pointer to a structure only; we have not
specified details of the <i>attributes</i> of the structure. We are
deliberately deferring this - the details of the implementation are irrelevant
at this stage. We are only concerned with the abstract behaviour of the
collection. <i>In fact, as we will see later, we want to be able to substitute
different data structures for the actual implementation of the collection,
depending on our needs.</i>
<P>
The <TT><FONT COLOR=green>typedef</FONT></TT> declaration provides us
with a C type (<I>class</I> in OO design parlance),
<TT><FONT COLOR=green>collection</FONT></TT>.
We can declare <I>objects</I> of type 
<TT><FONT COLOR=green>collection</FONT></TT> wherever needed.
Although C forces us to reveal that the handle for objects of the class
is a pointer, it is better to take an abstract view: we regard variables of
type <TT><FONT COLOR=green>collection</FONT></TT>
simply as <I>handles</I> to objects of the class and forget
that the variables are actually C pointers.
<P>

<A NAME=methods>
<H3>2.2.3 Methods</H3>

Next, we need to define the methods:<p>
<FONT COLOR=green>
<tt>collection ConsCollection( int max_items, int item_size );<br>
void AddToCollection( collection c, void *item );<br>
void DeleteFromCollection( collection c, void *item );<br>
void *FindInCollection( collection c, void *key );</tt>
</FONT>
<P>
Note that we are using a number of C
<a href=C_hacks.html>"hacks"</a> here.
C - even in <a href="ANSI_C.html">ANSI standard</a> form -
is not exactly the safest programming language in the sense
of the support it provides for the engineering of quality software.
However, its portability and extreme popularity mean that it is a practical
choice for even large software engineering projects. Unfortunately, C++,
because it is based on C, isn't much better.
<a href=ANSI_C.html#java>Java</a>, the latest fad in the
software industry, shows some evidence that its designers have learned from
experience (or actually read some of the literature in programming language
research!) and has eliminated some of the more dangerous features of C.<p>
Just as we defined our collection object as a pointer to a structure, we assume
that the object which belong in this collection are themselves represented by
pointers to data structures.
Hence in <tt><FONT COLOR=green>AddToCollection</FONT></tt>,
<tt><FONT COLOR=green>item</FONT></tt>
is typed <tt><FONT COLOR=green>void *</FONT></tt>.
In ANSI C, <tt><FONT COLOR=green>void * </FONT></tt>will match any pointer -
thus <tt><FONT COLOR=green>AddToCollection</FONT></tt> may be used to add any object to our collection.
Similarly, 
<TT><FONT COLOR=green>key</FONT></TT>
in <tt><FONT COLOR=green>FindInCollection</FONT></tt>
is typed <tt><FONT COLOR=green>void *</FONT></tt>, as the
key which is used to find any item in the collection may itself be some object.
<tt><FONT COLOR=green>FindInCollection</FONT></tt>
returns a pointer to the item which matches key, so
it also has the type <tt><FONT COLOR=green>void *</FONT></tt>.
The use of <tt><FONT COLOR=green>void * </FONT></tt>here
highlights one of the deficiencies of C: it doesn't provide the capability to
create generic objects, <i>cf</i> the ability to define generic packages in
<a href=ada.html>Ada</a> or 
<A HREF=notyet.html>templates</A> in C++.
<P>
Note there are various other <A HREF=C_hacks.html>"hacks"</a>
to overcome C's limitations in this area.
One uses the pre-processor. You might like to try to work out an alternative
approach and try to convince your tutor that it's better than the one set out
here!

<A name="pre-conditions">
<H3>2.2.4 Pre- and post-conditions</H3>

No formal specification is complete without pre- and post-conditions. A useful
way to view these is as forming a contract between the object and its client.
<i>The pre-conditions</i> define a state of the program which the client
guarantees will be true before calling any method, whereas the
<i>post-conditions</i> define the state of the program that the object's method
will guarantee to create for you when it returns.<p>
Again C (unlike <a href="eiffel.html">Eiffel</a>, for example) provides no
formal support for pre- and post-conditions. However, the standard does define
an <tt><FONT COLOR=green>assert</FONT></tt> function
which can (and should!) be used to verify pre- and post-conditions
[<A HREF=assert.html TARGET=assert>man page for assert</A>].
We will see how this is used when we examine an
implementation of our collection object. Thus pre- and post-conditions should
be expressed as comments accompanying the method definition. <p>
Adding pre- and post-conditions to the collection object would produce:<br>
<A HREF=source/collection.h TARGET=collection.h REL=parent>Select to load collection.h</A>
<p>
<b>Aside</b><p>
In order to keep the discussion simple at this stage, a very general
specification of a collection has been implied by the definitions used here.
Often, we would restrict our specification in various ways: for example, by not
permitting duplicates (items with the same key) to be added to the collection.
With such a collection, the pre- and post-conditions can be made more formal:<br>
<A HREF=source/ucollection.h TARGET=ucollection.h REL=parent>Select to load ucollection.h</A>
<p>
Note how the pre- and post-conditions now use the
<tt><FONT COLOR=green>FindInUCollection</FONT></tt> function to more precisely define the state of the
object before and after the method has been invoked. Such formal pre- and
post-conditions are obviously much more useful than the informal English ones
previously specified. They are also easier to translate to appropriate
assertions as will be seen when the implementation is constructed.

<A name="conventions">
<H3>2.2.5 C conventions</H3>

This specification - which all a user or client of this object needs to see (he
isn't interested in the implementation details) - would normally be placed in a
file with a <tt><FONT COLOR=green>.h</FONT></tt> (h = header) suffix to its name.
For the collection, we
would place the specifications in files called <tt><FONT COLOR=green>collection.h</FONT></tt> and
<tt><FONT COLOR=green>Ucollection.h</FONT></tt> and use the C <tt><FONT COLOR=green>#include</FONT></tt> facility to import them
into programs which needed to use them.
The implementation or body of the class
is placed in a file with a <tt><FONT COLOR=green>.c</FONT></tt> suffix.
