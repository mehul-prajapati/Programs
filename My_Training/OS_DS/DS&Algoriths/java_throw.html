<P>

Java, somewhat unfortunately,
follows C++ and has the 
<FONT COLOR=green><TT>try, throw, catch</TT></FONT>
mechanism.
<P>
However, Java defines a class hierarchy for errors,
all of which are specialisations of the 
<FONT COLOR=green><TT>exception</TT></FONT>
class.
<P>
Java exceptions, like Ada exceptions, are thrown
from one class method to the invoking method,
until it reaches a <FONT COLOR=green><TT>try</TT></FONT> block.
However Java methods explicitly list the
exceptions that they throw.
<FONT COLOR=green>
<PRE>void readFromFile( String s ) throws IOException,
                     InterruptedException {
       ......
       }

try {
    readFromFile( "abc" );
    }
catch( FileNotFoundException e ) { ..... }
catch( IOException e) { .... }
catch( Exception e ) {
    // catches any other error (Exception is the "superclass")
    ....
    }
finally {
    // Cleanup code - always executed
    }
</PRE></FONT>
The
<TT><FONT COLOR=green>finally</FONT></TT>
is executed whether an exception is thrown or not.
<P>
Despite inheriting a mess,
Java's designers have managed to simplify it to a
useable system.
<TT><FONT COLOR=green>catch</FONT></TT> <I>appears</I> (my text is not clear on
this point - a problem with Java's instant fame!)
to accept a single parameter belonging to the 
<TT><FONT COLOR=green>exception</FONT></TT> class.
As in Ada, many exceptions are pre-defined, 
but you can also define your own.
<P>
Note the problem of a precise definition of Java
is a perennial problem in the computer industry:
the tendency to instantly adopt "fads" before they
have a chance to be defined thoroughly
and unambiguously. 
This has lead to enormous porting problems and
enormous, <B>avoidable</B> costs for users.
<CENTER>
No professional engineer would design any system
using screws with non-standard threads!
