<PRE>RAND(3V)               C LIBRARY FUNCTIONS               RAND(3V)

NAME
     rand, srand - simple random number generator

SYNOPSIS
     srand(seed)
     int seed;

     rand()

DESCRIPTION
     rand() uses a multiplicative congruential random number gen-
     erator  with period 2**32 to return successive pseudo-random
     numbers in the range from 0 to (2**31)-1.

     srand() can be called at any time to reset the random-number
     generator to a random starting point.  The generator is ini-
     tially seeded with a value of 1.

SYSTEM V DESCRIPTION
     rand() returns successive pseudo-random numbers in the range
     from 0 to (2**15)-1.

SEE ALSO
     drand48(3), random(3)

NOTES
     The spectral properties of rand() leave a great deal  to  be
     desired.   drand48(3)  and  random(3)  provide  much better,
     though more elaborate, random-number generators.

BUGS
     The low bits of the numbers generated are not  very  random;
     use  the  middle  bits.  In particular the lowest bit alter-
     nates between 0 and 1.
